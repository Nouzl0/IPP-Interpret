# Introduction

This document provides instructions for using interpret.py, interpret which executes ippcode23.xml.
In this document are also notes of how the Interpret works and the design process/principles.

Interpret is meant to be used in combination with script parse.php.
Script parse.php is script which takes in raw ippcode and transforms it onto ippcode23.xml file.

## Requirements
To use this script, you will need:

- Python 3.10 installed in your system
- XML (ippcode23) file which has been created by the script parse.php which parsed raw ippcode23 file

## Input/Output

***Input*** - Interpret script has two input sources which are set by arguments, (--source=<file>.xml) and (--input=<file>).
 - If one of these arguments is not set than the (--source) or (--input) is set as default, (stdin)
 - If none of these arguments is set then the interpret (won't start)

***Input arguments***
- (--source) - is the (XML ippcode23), file which will be executed by the interpret 
- (--input) - is the interpret input from which can user of the interpret interact while the interpret is running

***Output*** - Interpret has one main output which is (stdout). This output is set by defalut and can't be changed


## Usage

Here are examples of how to use the interpret.

The default, in this case the interpret.py executes ippcode23.xml file, and all print messages sends to stdout. Users can interact with the interpreter through stdin.
 - source = ippcode23.xml, input = stdin, output = stdout
    
    $ interpret.py --source=ippcode23.xml

In this case the interpret.py executes source from stdin and and all print messages sends to stout. Users can't interact with the Interpret. When instruction READ appears in the source, the interpret will just read the line in the file.txt
 - source = stdin, input = file.txt, output = stdout
    
    $ interpret.py --input=file.txt
<br> <br> <br> <br>


# Design of the Interpret
The Interpreter is designed using object-oriented programming (OOP), mainly through composition. The classes that make up the interpret.py file include:

 - Interpret           - Manager class which runs the interpret 
 - InputParser         - Parses XML and interpret.py input
 - VariableAnalysis    - Checks if the variables have correct type and syntax
 - ExecuteInstruction  - Execute given instruction
 - FrameStackProtocol  - Interface for working with frames
 - FrameStack          - Implementation of stack with frames
 - SymbolTableData     - Class which represent an individual frame and is implemented as a symbol table
 - DataStack           - Stack witch var data and type
 - FuncCallStack       - Stack with instruction label numbers/pointers
 - SymbolTableJump     - Symbol table of instruction numbers/pointers that is accessed by label name/key

Together these classes for a compositional hierarchy which is illustrated in the diagrams below.

<br> <br>

# Other design aspects of the design
Here are described other important design decision of interpret.py. 

### Instruction class
The InputParser class has the ability to create an Instruction object, which serves more as a data structure or C-struct than a traditional class. Its main purpose is to store instruction data such as opcodes, order, and arguments. Therefore, while the Instruction class is depicted in the class diagram, it functions more like a container for instruction data than a typical class.
<br> <br> 

### Semantic checks
Interpret reads and checks instruction data line by line which means. This is done to correctly implement interactivity of instruction READ and make the Interpret more versatile/reactive. For instance, if the input code contains invalid instructions, such as referencing an undefined variable like LF@unknown the interpret will still print data to stdout. Of course the interpret will also print error mesage and exits with error code.

**Example:** - (source) code.xml

    DEFVAR GF@test 
    MOVE GF@test int@5
    WRITE GF@test
    WRITE string@Hello
    WRITE LF@unknown

**Result:** - (stdout) terminal
    
    $ interpret.py --source=code.xml
    5
    Hello
    [interpret.py] - ERROR (54) - SymbolTableData - set_var()

    $ echo $?
    54
<br>

### Possible expansions

If wanted here are some ways to expand the interpret.py

 - **adding new instructions** - this can be done easily in form of adding new instruction methods in ExecuteInstruction class and then adding them into instruction list which is in method run_instruction()

 - **adding new data types** - this can be done by adding the new-type and new-type methods in VariableAnalysis and FrameStack protocol. Also, the Interpret is strict about its types so error checking in InputParser must be also changed.

 - **adding even more instruction arguments** - for this to be done the InputParser class must be rechanged for this purpose. This change will not affect how the other classes work.

# Description of Interpret-Class

This class is the main class of the interpret.py script and is the interface for the user. The user can use the Interpret class to interpret the XML source file.

### Dependencies
The Interpret class depends on the following classes:
 - **InputParser class**            - used for parsing files and interpret.py arguments
 - **ExecuteInstruction class**     - used for executing individual instruction
 - **SymbolTableJump class**        - used for enabling jumps in the sym_table

### Attributes
- **source (File)** - the source file. The default value is sys.stdin.
- **input (File)**  - the input file. The default value is None.

### Methods

**read_args(self)**
 - This public method reads the interpret.py arguments from the command line. The method sets up the source file, input file, stati file, and stati arguments. This function doesn't need to be called by the user if they don't want to read the arguments.

**run_script(self)**
 - This public method runs the interpret.py script, interprets the source file, and executes the instructions.

**init_symt_jump(self, symt_jump)**
 - This method initializes the symt_jump class and saves the position of every label in the source file, which is later used for JUMP type instructions.

**run_instructions(self, inst)**
 - This method executes every instruction in the array of instructions and calls the appropriate method for every instruction.

### Usage as an interface 
To use the Interpret class, you can create an instance of it and call its read_args() method to read the arguments from the command line. You can then call the run_script() method to interpret the source file.

Here is an example of how to implement interpret ippcode23 in your python code.

    interpret = Interpret()
    interpret.read_args() 
    interpret.run_script()

# Detailed description other of classes

## InputParser Class
The InputParser class is used for parsing source code and instructions. It encapsulates the parsing capabilities of interpret.py.
